# Hypotheses-Shopping
Goal is to generate a plot illustrating the potential danger of having a lot of hypotheses when you are trying to discover 'statistically-significant' relationships from a large set of variables. 

All the x-variables are completely randomly generated in this example and so is the output y-variable i.e. there should not be any statistically significant relationship between x and y for any scenario.

But as the number of hypotheses increase, there is a definitive positive correlation (shown by the positively sloped linear fit line) between the number of statistically-significant P-values and the number of hypotheses i.e. bigger set of experimentation make it more likely discover a relationship between y and x even if they are fundamentally generated by uncorrelated random processes.
